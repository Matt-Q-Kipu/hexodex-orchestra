# hexodex-orchestra
Hexodex Orchestra is a proof-of-concept project. It transforms team structures into a living musical ensemble, combining JSON-driven logic, visual layouts, and integration tools to support coordination, composition, and collaboration.


Ideas: The Hexodex project reimagines a development team as an orchestra, with each pod and product group representing a distinct instrument section. The musical score can be performed as a full ensemble or by individual sections. Musicians — often percussionists — may switch between instruments or even move across sections between pieces. A dynamic “live seating chart” helps maintain structure during the performance and ensures the best possible outcome.

By applying an integration layer with a "bolt-on" philosophy, existing processes and workflows remain intact while lightweight tools like Python and JSON are used to unify data and metrics. The goal is to view, manage, and connect information from sources like ADP, Productboard, Jira, Hexona, and internal spreadsheets into a cohesive arrangement from which meaningful insights can be drawn.
